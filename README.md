# ps2-remote

## What is it?
Make my Playstation 2 reset button be controlled remotely. It uses an
infrared sensor (for the remote part), and a single input MUX (for
simulating a button press).

## Motivation
I don't want to get up to turn on and off my Playstation 2.

## Dependencies
Arduino Libraries:

* [Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote)

## Status
- [x] Working prototype on breadboard
- [x] Transfer off of Arduino board
- [x] Design PCB
- [x] Order PCB
- [x] Done!

## Future Goals
This project converts any button into an IR controlled button, however
it requires soldering and electrical knowledge to do so. A future goal
is to simplify the process to allow anyone to convert the buttons.
