#ps2-remote

##What is it?
Make my Playstation 2 reset button be controlled remotely. It uses an
infrared sensor (for the remote part), and a digital potentiometer
(for simulating a button press).

##Motivation
I don't want to get up to turn on and off my Playstation 2.

##Dependencies
Arduino Libraries:

* [Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote)

##Status
- [ ] Working prototype on breadboard
- [ ] Transfer off of Arduino board
- [ ] Design PCB
- [ ] Etch PCB
- [ ] Done!

##Future Goals
This project converts any button into an IR controlled button, however
it requires soldering and electrical knowledge to do so. A future goal
is to simplify the process to allow anyone to convert the buttons.
